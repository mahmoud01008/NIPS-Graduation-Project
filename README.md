# 🔐 Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)

> A graduation project developed to monitor, detect, and prevent cyber threats in real time using open-source technologies.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project presents a complete implementation of a **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)** designed to enhance cybersecurity by identifying and mitigating network attacks in real-time.

The system integrates multiple tools and platforms including:
- **Suricata** for deep packet inspection and rule-based threat detection
- **OPNsense** as a firewall and network management solution
- **Metasploit** for generating and simulating common attack vectors (e.g., DoS/DDoS)
- **Linux & VMware** for hosting and simulating the network environment
- **Python** scripts for log parsing, alert generation, and report analysis

✅ Deep packet inspection using Suricata  
✅ Configurable rule sets for custom detection  
✅ Attack simulation using Metasploit and Hping3  
✅ Log analysis and visualization using Python  
✅ Virtualized secure lab setup using VMware
